## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **senior data scientist** at BP, where I spearhead digital innovation across the trading and shipping organization.
I am an AI enthusiast with a strong background in machine learning, statistics, and software engineering.

My role is to drive innovation through advanced data science and analytics solutions, leading the development and adoption of generative AI ðŸ¤– across the trading and shipping organization. I am a leading member of BP's data & analytics and GenAI communities of practice, actively demystifying data science and AI across the business.

I hold master's degrees in Mechanical & Electrical Engineering from Robert Gordon University, and Applied Data Science from the University of Buckingham. I have led projects across various domains including demand forecasting, causal inference, and generative AI. I am a strong advocate for democratizing artificial intelligence and believe it can help us be more efficient, productive, and safe.
